        <p><strong>Welcome to GameVerse!</strong> This Privacy Policy ("Policy") applies to your access and use of the GameVerse website, located at <a href="https://online-games-indol.vercel.app/">https://online-games-indol.vercel.app/</a>, and all associated games (such as Chess, Wooden Block Puzzle, Tic Tac Toe, and any future additions), content, and services offered thereon (collectively, the "Service" or "GameVerse"). The Service is owned and operated by Kanhaiya Mishra ("we", "us", or "our").</p>
        <p>We are deeply committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users' information. This Policy is designed to provide you with clear and comprehensive information about our practices regarding the collection, use, storage, sharing, and protection of your data. It also outlines your rights and choices concerning your information. By accessing or using any part of the GameVerse Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Service.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding your personal information or this Policy, please do not hesitate to contact us. Our contact details are provided at the end of this document (Section 11).</p>

        <h2>1. Scope and Application of This Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected through your use of the GameVerse Service. This includes information collected when you play our games, browse our website, interact with advertisements, or communicate with us. This Policy does not extend to any third-party websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from our Service (e.g., links within advertisements or social media sharing buttons if implemented). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to review their privacy policies carefully before providing them with any personal information.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect and Its Purpose</h2>
        <p>To provide an engaging and functional gaming experience, and to support our Service through advertising, we collect certain types of information. Our philosophy is to collect only the data that is necessary for these purposes and to be transparent about how it is used.</p>

        <h3>a) Information You Voluntarily Provide to Us</h3>
        <p>GameVerse is designed to be enjoyed without requiring user registration or the mandatory submission of personally identifiable information (PII) to play our core games. The limited circumstances under which we might collect PII directly from you include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Direct Communications (Email, Contact Forms, Social Media):</strong> If you choose to contact us via email for support, to provide feedback, report a bug, make inquiries, or interact with us through our official social media channels (listed in the footer and Contact Us page), we will collect the information you voluntarily provide. This typically includes your name (if provided), email address, the content of your message, and any attachments. This information is used exclusively to respond to your communication, address your concerns, provide requested support, or consider your suggestions for improving GameVerse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b) Information Collected Automatically (Usage Data, Log Files, and Analytics)</h3>
        <p>When you access and interact with the GameVerse Service, our servers and third-party analytics/advertising tools automatically log certain non-personally identifiable or pseudonymized information. This "Usage Data" is essential for the operation, maintenance, and improvement of our Service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device and Connection Information:</strong> We collect technical information about the device and connection you use to access GameVerse. This includes your IP address (which can sometimes be used to infer your general geographic location, though we or our analytics partners may anonymize or truncate this), browser type and version (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox), operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Android, iOS), device model or type (more common for mobile web access), screen resolution, and language preferences. This helps us optimize game display and performance for different setups.</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction and Log Data:</strong> We log details about your interactions with our Service. This encompasses:
                <ul>
                    <li>The specific games you play (e.g., Chess, Wooden Block Puzzle, Tic Tac Toe) and how you interact with them (e.g., selected difficulty levels, game modes, themes chosen in Tic Tac Toe).</li>
                    <li>The pages you visit on GameVerse (e.g., homepage, game pages, policy pages) and the order in which you visit them.</li>
                    <li>The time and date of your visit and the duration spent on each page or game.</li>
                    <li>Referral URLs (the webpage that linked you to GameVerse, if any).</li>
                    <li>Clickstream data (the sequence of clicks you make while navigating the site).</li>
                    <li>Game-specific data like high scores for games such as Wooden Block Puzzle (note: this is typically stored in your browser's local storage, not on our servers).</li>
                    <li>Information about errors or crashes encountered, which helps us debug and improve stability.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Purpose of Collecting Usage Data:</h4>
        <p>This automatically collected Usage Data is invaluable for several key reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Improvement:</strong> Analyzing how users interact with games and features helps us identify areas for improvement, enhance usability, and make GameVerse more engaging.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Understanding browser types, device capabilities, and page load times allows us to optimize the performance of our games and website.</li>
            <li><strong>Bug Fixing and Stability:</strong> Error logs and crash reports are crucial for diagnosing and fixing technical problems, ensuring a stable gaming environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Strategy:</strong> Data on popular games and features informs our decisions about developing new content or enhancing existing offerings.</li>
            <li><strong>Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> IP addresses and log data can be used in aggregate to monitor for suspicious activity, protect against malicious attacks (like DDoS), and maintain the security and integrity of our Service.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>c) Cookies, Local Storage, and Similar Tracking Technologies</h3>
        <p>GameVerse, along with our third-party partners (most notably Google AdSense for advertising), utilizes cookies, web browser local storage, and similar tracking technologies (such as pixels or web beacons) to enhance your experience, operate our Service effectively, and support our advertising model. These technologies are small data files or code snippets placed on your device when you visit our website.</p>
        <h4>Types and Purposes:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Essential/Strictly Necessary Cookies & Local Storage:</strong> These are vital for the basic operation of GameVerse and cannot be disabled if you wish to use core features. They are used for:
                <ul>
                    <li>Remembering your game-specific preferences, such as chosen themes in Tic Tac Toe, sound volume settings, or last played difficulty in Chess or Wooden Block Puzzle. This data is typically stored in your browser's local storage.</li>
                    <li>Maintaining session information for certain interactive features, ensuring a smooth experience as you navigate between games or pages (though less critical for our current simple game setup).</li>
                    <li>Storing your high scores for games like Wooden Block Puzzle locally in your browser.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Performance & Analytics Cookies:</strong> If we implement tools like Google Analytics (or utilize Vercel Analytics), these cookies help us collect aggregated and largely anonymous information about how users interact with GameVerse. This includes tracking the number of visitors, a_i_sessions, popular pages, bounce rates, and sources of traffic. This data is instrumental in understanding user behavior and improving the Service's performance and content.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Cookies (Google AdSense):</strong> Google AdSense, our primary advertising partner, uses cookies (including the DoubleClick DART cookie and others) to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Serve advertisements on GameVerse.</li>
                    <li>Personalize the ads displayed to you based on your browsing history on GameVerse and other websites (interest-based advertising). This helps make ads more relevant and useful.</li>
                    <li>Control the number of times you see a particular ad.</li>
                    <li>Measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.</li>
                    <li>Prevent ad fraud.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="important-note">
            <p><strong>Control Over Locally Stored Data:</strong> Data such as your game high scores, theme choices, and sound preferences are stored in your browser's local storage or through cookies managed by your browser. You can typically clear this data by managing your browser's settings (e.g., clearing cache, cookies, and site data). Doing so may reset your preferences and scores on GameVerse.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Managing Your Cookie Preferences:</h4>
        <p>Most web browsers provide you with a range of options to manage cookies and similar technologies. You can usually find these settings in the "Options," "Settings," or "Preferences" menu of your browser. Typical controls allow you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>View the cookies currently stored by websites.</li>
            <li>Block all cookies, or only third-party cookies.</li>
            <li>Delete specific cookies or all cookies when you close your browser.</li>
            <li>Set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being set.</li>
            <li>Use "private" or "incognito" browsing modes, which typically do not retain cookie data after the session ends.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please be aware that if you choose to block or delete essential cookies or disable local storage, some parts of the GameVerse Service may not function correctly (e.g., your preferences might not be saved). For comprehensive information on cookie management for various browsers, websites like <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.youronlinechoices.com</a> are excellent resources. For AdSense specific opt-outs, please refer to Section 4.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Utilize Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information we collect, both voluntarily provided and automatically logged, is utilized for a variety of legitimate purposes aimed at enhancing your experience and ensuring the smooth operation of GameVerse:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Service Provision, Operation, and Maintenance:</strong> Our primary use of data is to deliver the core functionality of our games (Chess, Wooden Block Puzzle, Tic Tac Toe, etc.), ensure they run correctly across different devices and browsers, save your local preferences and scores, and maintain the overall operational integrity and stability of the GameVerse platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Personalization and User Experience Enhancement:</strong> We analyze aggregated Usage Data to understand how users interact with different games and features. This helps us personalize aspects of the Service (where applicable, e.g., remembering your theme in Tic Tac Toe) and make design improvements to enhance usability and overall user satisfaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics, Performance Monitoring, and Service Improvement:</strong> By tracking metrics such as popular games, session durations, page load times, and error rates, we gain insights into the performance of GameVerse. This data allows us to optimize game mechanics, improve server response times, identify and fix bugs, and make informed decisions about future game development and feature enhancements.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising and Monetization:</strong> As a free-to-play platform, GameVerse relies on advertising revenue, primarily through Google AdSense, to cover development, hosting, and maintenance costs. Information collected via cookies (as detailed in Section 2c and Section 4) is used to display advertisements, some of which may be personalized to your interests.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication and User Support:</strong> If you contact us directly with inquiries, feedback, or support requests, we use the information you provide (like your email address and the content of your message) to respond to you effectively and provide assistance.</li>
            <li><strong>Security, Fraud Prevention, and Legal Compliance:</strong> We may use Usage Data (such as IP addresses and log files) to monitor for and protect against malicious activities, unauthorized access, fraudulent behavior, and potential security threats to GameVerse and its users. We also use data as necessary to comply with applicable legal obligations, enforce our Terms of Service, and respond to lawful requests from public authorities.</li>
            <li><strong>Development of New Offerings:</strong> Insights gained from user interaction with current games can inspire the development of new games, features, or services that we believe our community will enjoy.</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Sections 4 through 11 would continue with the same level of detail as above, expanding on AdSense, Data Sharing, Security, Links, Children's Privacy, Data Rights, Policy Updates, and Contact Info, ensuring each section is thorough and clear. -->
        <!-- For brevity in this example, I will summarize the content for remaining sections but in your actual page, expand them similarly. -->

        <h2>4. Advertising, Google AdSense, and Your Choices</h2>
        <p>GameVerse is a free-to-play platform supported by advertising revenue generated through Google AdSense and potentially other third-party advertising networks. This section provides detailed information about how advertising works on our Service and the choices you have regarding ad personalization.</p>
        <h4>a) How Google AdSense Works:</h4>
        <p>Google AdSense is an advertising service provided by Google LLC. It allows website publishers like GameVerse to display targeted advertisements on their sites. Google and its partners use various technologies, most notably cookies (including the DoubleClick DART cookie), to collect information about your visits to GameVerse and other websites across the internet. This information helps them:
        <ul>
            <li>Deliver ads that are more relevant to your interests (Interest-Based Advertising or Personalized Advertising).</li>
            <li>Measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns (e.g., how many times an ad was shown or clicked).</li>
            <li>Limit the number of times you see the same ad.</li>
            <li>Detect and prevent fraudulent ad activity.</li>
        </ul>
        The information collected may include your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, pages viewed, time spent on pages, and interactions with ads. Google may also use web beacons or similar technologies in conjunction with cookies.</p>
        <h4>b) Personalized Advertising and Your Opt-Out Choices:</h4>
        <p>Personalized advertising aims to show you ads that are more likely to be of interest to you based on your past online activity. You have significant control over this:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Ad Settings:</strong> You can view and customize your Google ad personalization settings, or opt out of personalized advertising entirely, by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Ad Settings page</a>. Opting out does not mean you will no longer see ads; it means the ads you see may be less relevant.</li>
            <li><strong>Industry Opt-Out Tools:</strong> Many third-party ad networks, including those that may partner with Google, participate in industry self-regulatory programs. You can opt out of interest-based advertising from participating companies through tools provided by:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) at <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> (for US users).</li>
                    <li>The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">optout.networkadvertising.org/</a>.</li>
                    <li>The European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) at <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a> (for users in Europe).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mobile Device Settings:</strong> For mobile apps (not directly applicable to our web-based GameVerse but good to know), you can often opt out of interest-based advertising through your device's settings (e.g., "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" on Android).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>We strongly encourage you to review Google's policies for a comprehensive understanding:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Google uses information from sites or apps that use their services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1348695?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google AdSense Program Policies</a> (which we adhere to as publishers)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>By using GameVerse, you acknowledge that advertisements will be displayed. While we strive to ensure ads are appropriate and non-intrusive, the specific content of third-party ads is largely determined by the ad networks based on their targeting algorithms and your browsing history (if personalization is enabled).</p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure Practices</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and do not sell your personally identifiable information (PII) to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We may share or disclose information under the following specific and limited circumstances, always with a focus on necessity and appropriate safeguards:</p>
        <h4>a) With Trusted Service Providers:</h4>
        <p>We may engage reputable third-party companies and individuals ("Service Providers") to perform various functions on our behalf or to assist us in operating and analyzing our Service. These functions may include:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Website Hosting:</strong> Our Service is hosted on platforms like Vercel, which may process IP addresses and log data as part of their hosting infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Services:</strong> We may use analytics providers (e.g., Vercel Analytics, or potentially Google Analytics in the future) to help us understand how users interact with GameVerse. These providers typically collect aggregated and anonymized or pseudonymized data.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Partners:</strong> As detailed in Section 4, Google AdSense and its partners collect data to serve advertisements.</li>
        </ul>
        These Service Providers are granted access to your information only to the extent necessary to perform their designated tasks for us. They are contractually or legally obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>
        <h4>b) For Legal Requirements and Protection of Rights:</h4>
        <p>We may disclose your information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to:
        <ul>
            <li>Comply with a valid legal obligation, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, or other lawful request from public authorities (e.g., law enforcement agencies).</li>
            <li>Protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of GameVerse, Kanhaiya Mishra, our users, or the public. This includes enforcing our Terms of Service and investigating potential violations.</li>
            <li>Prevent, detect, or otherwise address fraud, security vulnerabilities, or technical issues.</li>
            <li>Protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety of GameVerse, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>c) In Case of Business Transfers (Hypothetical):</h4>
        <p>In the highly unlikely event that GameVerse or substantially all of its assets are acquired by, merged with, or invested in by a third party, or in the event of bankruptcy or a similar proceeding, user information (primarily aggregated Usage Data and analytics, as we collect very little PII) could be one of the assets transferred or disclosed. Should such a transfer occur, we would endeavor to ensure that the acquiring entity upholds commitments to privacy that are at least as protective as those outlined in this Policy, or we would provide you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out if your PII were to be subjected to a new privacy policy.</p>
        <h4>d) With Your Explicit Consent:</h4>
        <p>Beyond the circumstances described above, we would only share your personally identifiable information with third parties if we have obtained your explicit prior consent to do so.</p>
        <p>We do not share PII with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your express consent.</p>


        <h2>6. Data Security, Integrity, and Retention</h2>
        <h4>a) Our Security Measures:</h4>
        <p>We take the security of your information seriously and implement reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the data we collect from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, loss, or destruction. These measures include:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTTPS Encryption:</strong> Our website, GameVerse, is served over HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), which encrypts data transmitted between your browser and our servers, protecting it from interception during transit.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Hosting:</strong> We utilize reputable hosting providers (like Vercel) that implement their own robust security measures for their infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to any sensitive data (primarily aggregated analytics or direct communications) is restricted to authorized personnel (Kanhaiya Mishra) who require it for operational purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Reviews:</strong> We periodically review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.</li>
        </ul>
        However, it is important to acknowledge that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We encourage you to also take steps to protect your own information online, such as using strong passwords (if applicable to any services you use elsewhere) and being cautious about the information you share.</p>
        <h4>b) Data Integrity:</h4>
        <p>We aim to ensure that the information we process is accurate, complete, and current for the purposes for which it is used. As most of the data we collect is Usage Data or preferences stored locally on your device, the integrity of that local data is largely managed by your browser.</p>
        <h4>c) Data Retention:</h4>
        <p>We retain collected information for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usage Data and Analytics:</strong> Aggregated or anonymized Usage Data used for analytics and service improvement may be retained for extended periods to identify trends and inform development. However, raw log data containing potentially identifiable information like full IP addresses (if not already anonymized by our tools) is typically retained for a shorter period necessary for security, debugging, and operational purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Locally Stored Data:</strong> Information stored in your browser's local storage (e.g., high scores, theme preferences) remains on your device until you choose to clear your browser's cache, cookies, and site data. We do not have direct access to or control over this data once it's stored on your device by your browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Direct Communications:</strong> Emails or other direct communications you send to us may be retained for as long as necessary to address your query, maintain a record of our correspondence for support continuity, or as required for legal or business record-keeping purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        When information is no longer needed for its specified purpose, and there is no legal requirement to retain it, we will take reasonable steps to securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Links and External Services</h2>
        <p>The GameVerse Service may contain links to other websites, services, or applications that are not owned, operated, or controlled by us ("Third-Party Services"). For example, advertisements displayed on our site will often link to the advertiser's website. Additionally, we might include links to our social media channels or other relevant resources.</p>
        <p>When you click on a link to a Third-Party Service, you will be redirected from GameVerse to that third party's domain. We want to emphasize that we have no control over, and therefore assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, security practices, or any other aspect of these Third-Party Services. The inclusion of a link to a Third-Party Service on GameVerse does not imply our endorsement or approval of that service or its associated privacy practices.</p>
        <p>We strongly advise you to exercise caution and to carefully review the privacy policy and terms of service of every Third-Party Service you visit or interact with, especially before providing any personal information. Your interactions with such Third-Party Services are governed by their respective policies, not this one.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy and Protection (Adherence to COPPA and GDPR-K)</h2>
        <p>GameVerse is designed and intended for a general audience. While our games (Chess, Wooden Block Puzzle, Tic Tac Toe, etc.) are generally family-friendly and can be enjoyed by users of various ages, our Service as a whole is not specifically directed at or targeted towards children under the age of 13 (in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act - COPPA in the United States) or the relevant minimum age for online consent in other jurisdictions (e.g., typically 16, or as low as 13 with parental consent, under GDPR-K in the European Economic Area).</p>
        <h4>a) No Knowing Collection of Children's Data:</h4>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect, solicit, or maintain personally identifiable information (PII) from children under these applicable age limits without verifiable parental consent. Our data collection practices, as described in this Policy, are generally limited to Usage Data and locally stored preferences, which are not typically used to directly identify individual children.</p>
        <h4>b) For Parents and Guardians:</h4>
        <p>We encourage parents and legal guardians to actively monitor and supervise their children's online activities and to become familiar with the types of websites and games their children are visiting. If you are a parent or guardian and you become aware that your child has provided us with any personally identifiable information without your consent (e.g., by contacting us via email with their name and email address), please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:timelytrove.9354@gmail.com">timelytrove.9354@gmail.com</a>.
        Upon receiving such a notification, we will promptly take steps to:
        <ul>
            <li>Verify the parental/guardian relationship.</li>
            <li>Delete any such PII from our active records and systems.</li>
            <li>Take measures to prevent further collection from that child if appropriate.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>c) Google AdSense and Children:</h4>
        <p>As publishers using Google AdSense, we are obligated to comply with AdSense policies regarding children. We do not target our site or its ad placements towards children under the applicable age limits. Google AdSense has its own mechanisms to prevent the serving of interest-based ads to users it infers are children.</p>
        <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of young users and urge parents to discuss online safety and privacy with their children.</p>

        <h2>9. Your Data Protection Rights and Choices (GDPR, CCPA, and General User Rights)</h2>
        <p>GameVerse respects your privacy rights and provides you with reasonable access and control over any personal information we may process. Depending on your geographical location and the applicable data protection laws (such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for individuals in the European Economic Area, or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)/California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) for California residents), you may have specific rights regarding your personal data.</p>
        <h4>a) General Rights for All Users:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access to Information:</strong> You have the right to know what personal information, if any, we hold about you. Given our current model, this would primarily apply to any information you've provided through direct communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Correction/Rectification:</strong> If you believe any personal information we hold about you (from direct contact) is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to request its correction.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion/Erasure:</strong> You may request the deletion of personal information we hold about you (from direct contact), subject to certain legal or operational retention needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Managing Cookies and Local Storage:</strong> As detailed in Section 2c, you can control cookies and locally stored data through your browser settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Opting Out of Personalized Advertising:</strong> As detailed in Section 4, you can opt out of personalized advertising from Google and other participating third-party ad networks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>b) Specific Rights under GDPR (for EEA Residents):</h4>
        <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the following additional rights under GDPR:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You can request that we restrict the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances (e.g., if you contest its accuracy).</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Object to Processing:</strong> You can object to our processing of your personal data under certain circumstances, particularly where we process it based on legitimate interests.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> Where applicable, you can request to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to transmit this data to another controller.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> If we rely on your consent as the legal basis for processing your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Lodge a Complaint:</strong> You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory data protection authority in your country of residence if you believe our processing of your personal data infringes applicable data protection laws.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>c) Specific Rights under CCPA/CPRA (for California Residents):</h4>
        <p>If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), provides you with specific rights regarding your personal information:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Know/Access:</strong> You have the right to request information about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which it was collected, the business or commercial purposes for collecting or "selling" (as broadly defined by CCPA) personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You have the right to request the deletion of your personal information that we have collected, subject to certain exceptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing:</strong> We do not "sell" your personal information in the traditional sense of exchanging it for monetary consideration. However, the CCPA's definition of "sale" is broad and may encompass the use of advertising cookies that share information with ad partners for interest-based advertising. You can exercise your right to opt-out of such "sales" or "sharing" for cross-context behavioral advertising by utilizing the cookie management tools and advertising opt-out links provided in Section 2c and Section 4 of this Policy. We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA/CPRA rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Correct Inaccurate Information:</strong> You have the right to request the correction of inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information (SPI):</strong> We do not currently collect information that is typically defined as SPI under CCPA/CPRA (e.g., social security number, financial account information, precise geolocation, genetic data).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>d) Exercising Your Rights:</h4>
        <p>To exercise any of these rights that may be applicable to you, or if you have any questions, please contact us using the details provided in Section 11 (Contact Information). We will respond to verifiable consumer requests within the timeframes mandated by applicable law (e.g., typically within 45 days for CCPA requests, extendable once if necessary). We may need to verify your identity before processing your request.</p>

        <h2>10. Policy Updates, Modifications, and Notification of Changes</h2>
        <p>The digital landscape, online gaming, and data privacy laws are constantly evolving. Therefore, we reserve the right to update, amend, or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and at our sole discretion to reflect changes in our data practices, the features of our Service, technological advancements, or applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
