        <h2>4. Data Retention and Security</h2>
        <p>We will retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>GameVerse is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction).
